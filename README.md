This application was built as a small HTML+CSS+JavaScript project. Having little to no background in frontend development, I made use of the [phind.com](https://phind.com) ai-assistant to get snippets of code and thorough explanations about each command.

I wanted to get introduced to basic concepts. Here is a list of things you can find in this application:
* basic CSS classes
* basic CSS commands (fonts, margins, padding ...)
* easy JS scripts and methods:
  * `.addElement`
  * `.addEventListener`
  * concept of parent node and append/remove child
  * localStorage
* Basic HTML (document, body, div, list ul, list element li, form and input)

I also packaged this application using node.js and electron. You can find the `pacakge.json` file in this repository.

If you would like to know how I packaged this code in greater detail, please go to [this page](https://bastiengolomer.github.io/2023/12/23/Packaging-using-electron.html). I give the commands to install electron (assuming you already have node.js installed and ready to go on your machine) and details on packaging the app.

A first step towards more software engineering, one must start somewhere!
